# 📄 Tiptap Document Editor with Real-Time Pagination

A Google Docs-like document editor that shows page breaks as you type. Built for legal professionals who need to see exactly how their documents will look when printed.

> **Live Demo**: Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000

## 🎯 What Does This Do?

When you type a letter or document, this editor automatically:
1. Shows you a **US Letter sized page** (8.5" × 11")
2. Creates a **new page** when your content overflows
3. Displays **page numbers** at the bottom
4. Makes the **print output match** exactly what you see

Think of it like Microsoft Word or Google Docs - you see the page boundaries while typing.
